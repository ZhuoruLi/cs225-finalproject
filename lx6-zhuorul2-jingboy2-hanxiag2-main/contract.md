## CS 225 Data Structures
## Team Contract （lx6-zhuorul2-jingboy2-hanxiag2）
### Communication
- **Team meetings**
Our team will meet twice a week every Tuesday and Friday from 2-5 PM in Grainger Library.
Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with *Longcong Xu(lx6)*. Notes will
be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting.
- **Assistance**
Each team member can be contacted through WeChat and Email. Outside
of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to group chat in WeChat within 12 hours.
- **Respect**
The person who records each meeting becomes the leader of the group for that meeting. Maintain the order of the meeting. Our team members ensure that each team member's input is treated with courtesy and seriousness, that conflicts are allowed to exist and can be effectively resolved, and that there are no incidents that interfere with the completion of the project.
### Collaboration
- **Work Distribution**
At the beginning of each meeting, we set the goals for the meeting. For example, we need to complete the contract section and the final project proposal section by Friday of the first week. After that, we will discuss the task as a whole and discuss in detail how to accomplish the goals. Each person's task will be discussed afterwards and distributed as fairly as possible according to the strengths of each person in the group. While completing the task, each person can always ask questions and we will work together to solve them. If at the end of the meeting there are still tasks that are not completed, we will set a deadline to avoid any impact on the plan later.
- **Time Commitment**
To ensure the efficiency of the project, we first assign tasks according to the strengths of the group members. For example, if A is good at data processing, we assign him to clean the data and filter the valid data, and if B is good at analyzing algorithms, we assign him to build the algorithm code framework. Each team member can choose their favorite task. Some tasks may require collaborative work, and we choose to discuss them in the group discussion area on the first floor of the Grainger library, with one of the team members screen sharing. To upload the code to GitHub efficiently, we do not let multiple team members edit a file at the same time.
- **Conflict resolution**
If the group members disagree during project discussions, we will rationally analyze each implementation or option. We vote to determine the "winner", and in the case of a 2:2 situation, we use the choice of the group member with the most experience in this area.
